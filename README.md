# Reddit-client

A sample React.js app which uses firebase as its DB to form a Reddit-client.

In case you still wanna see the demo of this little chunky, here you go:
```
git clone "https://github.com/harishankards/reddit-client"
cd reddit-client/
yarn start
```

Now go check here: `localost:3000`
